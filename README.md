# Lositan

I made some minor modifications to the Lositan installation scripts that update urls to required java libraries. Hopefully this will help people install and run the program locally on their machines.

## Installation:
I successfully performed the installation on a computer running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Python 2.7.6, and Java 1.8.0_91. No other systems have been tested.

To install, clone this repository and cd into the lositan directory. Execute the installation scripts in the following order:
`./getLibs.sh`

`./prepareLibs.sh`

`./prepareLocalExec.sh`

## Running the program
Execute the runLocal.sh script to run Lositan. You will likely see a bunch of warnings printed to your terminal window, but the program ran fine for me.

`./runLocal.sh`
